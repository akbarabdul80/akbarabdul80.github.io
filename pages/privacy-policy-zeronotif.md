At Zero Notification, we value and respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our application.
1. Information We Collect: We do not collect any personal data or information from your notifications. Zero Notification operates solely to read out your notifications and does not store or transmit any personal data to our servers or third parties.
2. Use of Information: Since we do not collect any personal data, we do not use your information for any purpose other than providing the intended functionality of the application. We do not track, analyze, or monetize your notifications in any way.
3. Security: We prioritize the security and confidentiality of your personal information. As Zero Notification does not collect any personal data, there is no risk of unauthorized access, loss, or misuse of your information through our application.
4. Third-Party Links: Zero Notification may contain links to third-party websites or applications. However, once you leave our application, we have no control over the privacy practices or content of those external sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party sites or applications before providing any personal information.
5. Children's Privacy: Zero Notification is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or store personal information from children under 13 years of age. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to promptly delete the information.
6. Changes to the Privacy Policy: We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect any changes in our practices or legal requirements.
